Anatomical fiducials (AFIDs) is an open framework for evaluating correspondence in brain images and teaching neuroanatomy using anatomical fiducial placement. Here you'll find a web application that allows you to upload an FCSV file generated using the AFIDs protocol, and validate that it conforms to the protocol.

## What is AFIDs?

Accurate spatial correspondence between template and subject images is a crucial step in neuroimaging studies and clinical applications like stereotactic neurosurgery. In the absence of a robust quantitative approach, we sought to propose and vali- date a set of point landmarks, anatomical fiducials (AFIDs), that could be quickly, accurately, and reliably placed on magnetic resonance images of the human brain. Using several publicly available brain templates and individual participant datasets, novice users could be trained to place a set of 32 AFIDs with millimetric accuracy. Furthermore, the utility of the AFIDs protocol is demonstrated for evaluating subject-to-template and template-to-template registration. Specifically, we found that commonly used voxel overlap metrics were relatively insensitive to focal mis- registrations compared to AFID point-based measures. Our entire protocol and study framework leverages open resources and tools, and has been developed with full transparency in mind so that others may freely use, adopt, and modify. This pro- tocol holds value for a broad number of applications including alignment of brain images and teaching neuroanatomy.

## Why AFIDs is important?
With the central aim of fulfilling the chief requirements for analyzing the neuroimaging data, 
AFIDs assissts you in a way to achieve those by identifying the best spatial normalization as required. 
In pursuance to providing a quantitative report of spatial correspondence between structural magnetic resonance images
of the brain, AFIDs acts as complementary to segmentation‐based metrics,  using more intuitive distance‐based measures of
alignment. Enabling reproducibility acrross sites and centers using the protocols, AFIDs has proven its utility 
and accessibility as an Open Framework with one of the main motives of exentending the teaching resources in the sphere of
neuroanatomy using anatomical fiducial placement.
Referencing the protocols for evaluating subject‐to‐template and template‐to‐template registration, 
AFIDs has proven to be sensitive to focal misregistrations that may be missed using other commonly used evaluation methods, 
which helps it to have its valuable place in a broader number of applications including intersubject alignment and teaching neuroanatomy.
